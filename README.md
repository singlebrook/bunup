# Bunup

Update Gemfile dependencies and commit to git with one command.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'bunup'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install bunup

## Usage

### Bunup a single gem

```bash
bunup rake
```

### Bunup multiple gems

```bash
bunup rake rubocop
```

### Bunup all gems

```bash
bunup --all
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, enter the project directory and run the following:

```bash
bundle
COVERAGE=1 bundle exec rake
```

`bin/console` is an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. 

To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then 
run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, 
push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to 
[rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
